Interface:

    Show Ranges: Will show the acceptable ranges of values on the numerical variables

    Outliars: The script automatically picks on outliars so, if any is inputed by the user and submited (on the Sumbit button), it will print out "Value Not Accepted" 

    Variables: Variables must be inputed by the user on every dropdown/text box 

    Submit Button: It either print "Patient Will Survive" or "Patient Will NOT Survive" based on the prediction of our GradientBoosting machine learning algorithm 
                    (which was what we foudn more effective in general)

    Show Graphs: It will show the graphs regarding the following variables of the patient:

            1st and 2nd graph - Histogram between not cleansed data and the cleansed data ("?" substitued by the mean)

            3rd graph - Graphic comparison between the values with the outliars and another graph which the outliars have been removed (outliars were gaven the value of the
                        higher acceptable value of that one variable)

    Machine Learning Methods used: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, KNN, TreeDecision

PS: File paths may need to be adjusted after the compression and decompression of the file, we advise to have the folder "Projeto Final IACD directly on the desktop and only after 
    that open it with your text editor
